    "Primarily, morphometrics can be used to address galaxy morphology. Different works use a non-parametric approach to measure a galaxy's shape characteristics. `Lotz et al. (2004)` characterize galaxies' Concentration, Asymmetry. Furthermore, `Ferrari et al. (2015)` include Shannon entropy (information entropy) to quantify pixel values distribution. More recently, `Rosa et al. (2018)` characterized a galaxy's morphology using the second moment of the gradient of the images through Gradient Pattern Analysis. One of the critical features of non-parametric morphology estimation is understanding how a given parameter can reliably separate elliptical and spiral galaxies. Each metric measures patterns and forms in the image. Concentration (C) measures how tightly pixels are distributed in the galaxy structure, Asymmetry (A) measures irregularity of the form of the galaxy's disk and bulge, Smoothness (S) measures the presence of the small structures in the galaxy's disk (star-forming regions), Entropy (H) is the measure of the heterogeneity of the pixel distribution and G2 analyses the asymmetric vector field (variation of flux intensity). When applied to an image with a clearly elliptical galaxy, usually, C will have high values, and A, S, H, and G2 will have low values. While in the case of a clearly spiral galaxy, it would be the opposite. Combining these values can provide a solid intuition of the class of unknown galaxies. \n",

Each of these metrics (except G2) ranges from 0 (min) to 1 (max) depending on the particular features of the content of the image. These metrics have a wide range of application in further resurch."

Galaxies are resolved objects with poorly defined edges and do not all have the same radial surface brightness profile; some care is required to define the flux associated with each object. The $\\eta$ profile is necessary to obtain the Petrosian radius ($R_p$) because the total flux of a galaxy is defined by the accumulated flux until $2*R_p$. The aperture $2*R_p$ is large enough to contain nearly all the flux for typical galaxy profiles but small enough that the sky noise impact is negligible `Blanton et al. (2001)`. Based on the $\\eta$ profile, it is also largely insensitive to variations in the limiting surface brightness and redshift  (in the sense of distance), providing reliable results for the galaxies with a high signal-to-noise ratio.\n",

The left panel in Figure 1 shows the portions in $R_p$ and $2*R_p$. Finally, it becomes possible to set the radii that contain the fractions of total flux. Intuitively and as it could be seen in the Figure 2, elliptical galaxies have the flux concentrated in the center, and it falls almost entirely in the R2 radius, leaving R1 with almost equal to R2 and pushing the ratio up. The opposite occurs with spiral galaxies, the main portion of the flux is concentrated in the center, but the spiral arms increase the total flux located in R2 and drive the ratio down."

Instead of rotation, we are applying a second order of the Butter filter to smooth the original image. This filter provides the advantage of continuous adaptive control of the smoothing degree applied to the image `(KASZYNSKI; PISKOROWSKI, 2006; PEDRINI; SCHWARTZ, 2008; SAUTTER, 2018)`. By intuition, if one tries to smooth the elliptical galaxy, the result will be almost the same image because naturally, these galaxies are smooth. Scanning the images, storing the pixels to lists, and calculating the coefficient will result in a high correlation between the segmented and smoothed image. Spiral galaxies will produce the opposite result, for the correlation will be low between the images, and clumpiness will be high. The formula to obtain S is $S = 1 - spearmanr(list1, list2)$."

In a simplified manner, H measures the distribution of pixel values in the image by dividing the image in an arbitrary number of bins.
