    "There are different ways to address galaxy morphology. Different works use a non-parametric approach to measure galaxy's shape characteristics. \\citeonline{2004AJ....128..163L} characterize galaxies Concentration, Asymmetry. Furthermore, \\citeonline{2015ApJ...814...55F} include Shannon entropy (\\cite{bromiley2004shannon}, information entropy) to quantify pixel values distribution. More recently, \\citeonline{2018MNRAS.477L.101R} characterize galaxy's morphology using the second moment of the gradient of the images through Gradient Pattern Analysis. One of the important features of non-parametric morphology estimation is to understand how a given parameter can reliably separate elliptical and spiral galaxies. Each metric measures patterns and forms in the image. Concentration (C) measures how tightly pixels are distributed in the galaxy structure, Asymmetry (A) measures irregularity of the form of the galaxy's disk and bulge, Smoothness (S) measures the presence of the small structures in the galaxy's disk (star-forming regions), Entropy (H) is the measure of the heterogeneity of the pixel distribution and G2 analyses the asymmetric vector field (variation of flux intensity). When applied to an image with a clearly elliptical galaxy, usually, C will have high values, and A, S, H, and G2 will have low values. While in the case with a clearly spiral galaxy, it would be the opposite. The combination of these values can provide a solid intuition of the class of unknown galaxies. \n",

The values of $R_1$ and $R_2$ can vary arbitrary, in range of 100 to 0 (containing all flux and none of it). Several studies used different pairs of $R_1$ and $R_2$ \\cite{lotz2004new, ferrari2015morfometryka}.

    "The processing starts by calculating the accumulated flux intensity curve and $\\eta$ profile on the cleaned image. Galaxies are resolved objects with poorly defined edges and do not all have the same radial surface brightness profile; some care is required to define the flux associated with each object. The $\\eta$ profile is necessary to obtain the Petrosian radius ($R_p$) because the total flux of a galaxy is defined by the accumulated flux until $2*R_p$. The aperture $2*R_p$ is large enough to contain nearly all the flux for typical galaxy profiles but small enough that the sky noise impact is negligible \\cite{blanton2001luminosity}. Based on the $\\eta$ profile, it is also largely insensitive to variations in the limiting surface brightness and redshift  (in the sense of distance), providing reliable results for the galaxies with a high signal-to-noise ratio. However, it has a drawback, consisting in being computationally heavy, more on this in the Section \\ref{performance}.\n",

Intuitively and as it could be seen in the Figure \\ref{c_showcase}, elliptical galaxies have the flux concentrated in the center, and it falls almost entirely in the R2 radius, leaving R1 with almost equal to R2 and pushing the ratio up. The opposite occurs with spiral galaxies, the main portion of the flux is concentrated in the center, but the spiral arms increase the total flux located in R2 and drive the ratio down."
